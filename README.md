![Matrix](icons/matrix_64x64.png?raw=true "Matrix")

Yet another matrix implementation.

## Caution!

Pretty old and bloated JavaScript code -- be aware that this monolithic
_beast_ could make your computer explode.

## How does it look like?

It could look like
[this](http://sangerardo.de/beasts/matrix/contents/code/main.html?effect_3d=true),
[that](http://sangerardo.de/beasts/matrix/contents/code/main.html) or
sth. else...

## History

Actually, these bunch of files comprise a so-called "plasmoid" -- a
term mainly (and hardly) used in the _KDE/Plasma 4_ era. Nowadays you
would rather call it "widget".

Whatsoever, even though it is thought to be used as a widget from the
Desktop (right away), you could simply call it via a web browser, too.
(Well, at least a subset of features -- see links above.)

## More

For even more information (screenshots, installation instructions and
so on) take a look at the [KDE store](https://store.kde.org/p/1002159/).
Be aware that this particular page loads extremely slowly -- perhaps some
[indirection](https://store.kde.org/browse/cat/106/page/20/ord/rating/)
might help you out.
