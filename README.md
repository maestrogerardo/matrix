Yet another Matrix Implementation

## Caution!

Pretty old and bloated JavaScript code -- be aware that this monolithic
_beast_ could make your computer explode.

## How does it look like?

It could look like
[this](http://maestrogerardo.com/foo/matrix/extra/html/crazy.html),
[that](http://maestrogerardo.com/foo/matrix/extra/html/insane.html) or
[sth.](http://maestrogerardo.com/foo/matrix/contents/code/main.html?effect_3d=true)
else...

## History

Actually, these bunch of files comprise a so-called
"[Plasmoid](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Plasmoids)" -- a term mainly
(and hardly) used during the _KDE/Plasma 4_ era. Nowadays you would rather
call it _widget_.

Whatsoever, even though it is thought to be used as a widget from the
Desktop (right away), you could also call it via an ordinary web browser.
(Well, at least a subset of features -- see links above.)

## More

For even more information (screenshots, installation instructions and
so on) take a look at the [KDE store](https://store.kde.org/p/1002159/)!
